    <br>

    <h3>&#8226 Hunger - Water is incredibly required to grow crops <br>
        and to care for livestock animals. It is estimated <br>
        that the global use of water for irrigation and agriculture <br>
        is about 70% and that only 10% is utilized for domestic purposes. <br>
    people will starve because of hunger.</h3><br><br>

    <h3>&#8226 Poor Heath - In many developing nations, water scarcity forces <br>
        people to drink water of low quality from flowing streams, majority<br>
         of which are contaminated. Accordingly, they are infected with <br>
         water-borne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and dysentery that<br>
         kill people. </h3>

   <h3>&#8226 Poverty - Access to quality water is fundamental to better <br>
            living standard and economic growth. Schools, restaurants, hospitals, <br>
            hotels and other businesses need to stay clean for operations to <br>
            run effectively.</h3>
 
  <h3>&#8226 Habitat Loss and Destruction to Ecosystems - When water is scarce, <br>
    then it means the natural landscapes suffer the most as it contributes to <br>
    desertification, lose of plants and death of wildlife and other animals. <br>
    As a result, these ecological catastrophes create habitat loss that, in turn,<br>
    leads to food shortages and poor quality of life. For instance, the Aral <br>
    Sea in Central Asia that used to be the world’s fourth largest <br>
    freshwater lake has been reduced by more than a third in a period of <br>
    only three decades.</h3>

<h3>&#8226 Disappearance of Wetlands - According to WWF, more than half of <br>
    the planet’s wetlands have lost since 1990 which is largely due to water <br>
    scarcity. The wetlands have become dry to the point of losing its natural <br>
    capability to hold water. Human activities are the main contributors <br>
    because of water overuse, pollution, and interference with the underground <br>
    aquifers.</h3>
